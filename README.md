This is a copy of the Python-JabberBot framework

The official repository is avaiiable here

http://thp.io/2007/python-jabberbot/
See the README file for more informations

This for is mostly for my own convenience, since I'm working on a bot
based on this framework and I may need to modify some behaviors / add
features
